	<h2>Web and Digital Design Students</h2>
 <p>An understanding of computer science is becoming increasingly essential in today’s world.  Every job we're going to do in the future will rely on technology.  Therefore, it is important that every student around the world be given the opportunity to learn computer science.  By starting early, students will have an opportunity to create a foundation for success in any career path. Learning how to code programs stretches your mind, helps you think better, nurtures problem-solving skills, and will enhance your creativity.</p><p>According to Code.org, there were less than 50,000 Computer Science graduates in 2018.  But there are over 500,000 open computing positions (Links to an external site.) in the United States. If this rate continues, by 2025, the available seats for these positions will exceed qualified applicants by almost 2 million and the gap is continuing to rise.  Based on the research, there are currently more than 900,000 computer related job openings in the US right now.  Companies are finding it extremely challenging to find the right talent.  To address this shortage many tech organizations are now turning to applicants with little to no experience and providing their own training programs for employees to fill these gaps</p>
	<p>Some of highest-paying jobs are also in this industry. The chart and list below show the name of the career, average starting salary, and educational requirements.</p>

		<h2>Comparing Computer Science Careers</h2>
		<p><strong>Software
			developers</strong>s
			are the creative minds behind computer programs. Some develop applications that allow people to perform specific tasks on a computer or another device. Others develop the underlying systems that run the devices or control networks.</p>
		<br>
<p>
		<strong>Computer hardware engineers</strong>
		are responsible for designing, developing, and testing computer components, such as circuit boards, routers, and memory devices. Computer hardware engineers need a combination of creativity and technical expertise. They must be avid learners who stay on top of emerging trends in the field to create hardware that can accommodate the latest programs and applications. Computer hardware engineers must have the perseverance to perform comprehensive tests of systems, again and again, to ensure the hardware is functioning properly.</p>
<p><br>
	<strong>Web developers</strong>
	(Links to an external site.) build and shape visitors’ experiences at websites. They do this through the creation of page layouts (headings and paragraphs), website styling (colors and fonts), and page features (animations and pictures). Interactive features, such as submitting online payments securely, are a necessary feature of ecommerce sites.</p><br>
<p><strong>
	Video Game Designers </strong>
	must possess excellent communication skills, have a strong ability to write, and be able to communicate ideas clearly. Game developers are just what they sound like, individuals who make video games. The talents of many people go into creating a game.  If you find yourself spending hours on end playing your favorite video games, this just might be the right career for you. Video and computer games have become one of the largest segments of the entertainment industry</p><br>
	<p>Computer systems analysts (Links to an external site.) study organizations' current computer systems and procedures and design solutions to help operate more efficiently and effectively. They bring business and information technology (IT) together by understanding the needs and limitations of both.</p><br>
	<p>Database administrators (Links to an external site.) analyze and evaluate the data needs of users. They develop and improve data resources to store and retrieve critical information. They need the problem-solving skills of the computer science major to correct any malfunctions in databases and to modify systems as the needs of users evolve.</p><br>
	<p>Information security analysts (Links to an external site.) create systems to protect information networks and websites from cyber-attacks and other security breaches. Their responsibilities also include researching trends in data security to anticipate problems and install systems to prevent issues before they occur. Security analysts also need strong problem-solving skills to investigate breaches, determine the causes, and modify or repair security systems.</p><br>
